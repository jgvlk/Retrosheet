Field 12 explanation

This field will contain a makeup date if the postponed game was played at
another time or place. If an attempt was known to have been made on a date but
postponed again, that date will be listed. In that case, there will be a second
date for the date when the game was actually played, in this form: "20150428;
20150528" For the note about a team folding, the team code is one of the
standard Retrosheet team IDs. The same is true for the team played as note.
Often, the two of these are combined in one field. The teams that folded are:
